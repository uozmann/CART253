## Concept Overview

Historically, womenâ€™s social status across the globe experienced various states; while their positions are widely studied in dominant civilizations, it is not so much the case of smaller ethnic groups. Growing up as a person of minority ethnicity in China, I have been taught many local legends, leaving the younger me fascinated. However, looking back at those stories, there is some unexplained incoherence in the narrations that troubles me, mainly in the transparency of female characters. 

In the tale of the Cloud of Eternal Sorrow, for example, we observe an almost muted opinion of the princess on events that have happened to her. Thus, I want to re-propose an imagined version of the legend that will tell the story from her own perspective, respond to the abnormalities such as why would she follow the man to a cave in the mountain, leading to her lonely death?

The player will start as a soul in the cave, with the skeleton of the princess, going on a quest that will reveal their identity. The soul will enter a maze that will gradually reveal the story. When all the events have been seen, it will be redirected to the cave and will guess the identity of the skeleton (the princess). Upon successful guess, the hidden reality of her relationship with the man and her death will be revealed. The soul then flies to the mountain and becomes the cloud of eternal sorrow.



## Gameplay

1. Narration Sequences:
    
    The visual elements in the narrations are all sensible to mouse hovering. 
    
    When the players move the mouse they can look at different parts of the scene, thus giving a camera effect. The characters on the foreground also rotates with the mouse hovering, but at different angles, which aims to give a sense of perspective to the narration scenes.

    The soul in the cave moves at random directions, but the player can also controle its height with the mouse hovering for interractive purposes.

    In the end, the player have the choice to type in an answer, which will direct the player to different ending depending on the answer typed.

2. Maze

    The maze has an unique function: it is a metaphor for the process of finding one's self. The clues, or memories hidden inside the maze are the lost lines that one tries to trace back.

    Originally, I wanted to attach the image of a map to help players find the correct clue in the maze, however I feel like it doesn't corresponds to the maze's concept as mataphor of the quest for identity, because it reveals all too clearly and too abruptly. So I thought of adding a guiding lantern to the soul that is always orientated towards the direction that the player wants to seek (always orientated towards the next clue). It accomplishes the same role, but leaves more freedom and mystery.

    Once a clue has been viewed, the player could not get back to it anymore, instead the player will be directed to a small narrative that contains a confusing mix of all the memories.

    When the player touches a wall of the maze, it's opacity decreases, until the wall becomes invisible, but it still exists and could not be passed through. With this, I want to convey the fragility of this self-finding process, as one can easily lost their ambitions, values, stands, and persistence when the quest seems too hard.

    Finally, there is a key in the maze that opens up all the walls and facilitates the quest, however in order to get it player must go through more turns than he/she needs if they head directly to the first clue.


## Artistic Vision

All the visual elements are made by myself. The style incorporates both traditional Chinese ink painting, and modern simplicity of the abstract. The scenes are all from Dali (my homeland), which is the self-governed territory of the Bai people which I am part of. Scenes such as the three pagodes, the lake (Erhai) and the bird view of the village (He qing, the village my grand-mother comes from and where I passed the happiest moments of my childhood) are all historically part of the Nan Zhao kingdom (738-902) where the legend happened.

Here are some (not all) reference photos taken from old painting of the Nan Zhao kingdom that I based on for the characters:

## Codes requirements:
I have incorporated all the concepts learnt in class: drawing instructions (yes), images (a lot), conditionals (a lot), loops (for the soul animation, image preloads, maze, the clues, the clue buttons, etc.), functions (yes), arrays (a lot), object-oriented programming (maze, clues, clue buttons), and the sound library (musics and sound effect when there is a collision with the maze).
